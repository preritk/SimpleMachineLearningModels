# KNN-algorithm
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique.

Here this method is used to pedict the type of iris . The program divides the dataset into 2 parts :Training set and test set . 
Then it finds out eucledian distance of each test case with each  training case and then according to the distances it predicts the type of iris.
